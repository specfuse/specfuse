# The Specfuse gate-cycle methodology

This document is the canonical definition of the gate cycle: the shared
vocabulary and contracts that the Specfuse Loop and the Specfuse Orchestrator
both implement. It is written to be implementation-agnostic — the loop runs it
single-repo with a driver script; the orchestrator runs it multi-repo with
agents and a polling loop — but the *concepts* defined here mean the same thing
on both surfaces.

> **Authoring note.** While the gate cycle is being proven, the loop is its
> near-term author: the loop runs real features first, and what it learns
> revises these contracts before they are folded into the orchestrator's frozen
> baselines. See [`concepts/architecture-addendum-gates-and-iterative-planning.md`](concepts/architecture-addendum-gates-and-iterative-planning.md)
> for how the cycle maps onto the orchestrator's state machine and agent roles.

## 1. The unit hierarchy

- **Roadmap** — the master index of features for a repository/project, with each
  feature's status (`planned → active → done`/`abandoned`). A feature may also be
  `deferred` — parked pending an external decision or dependency: nothing is
  loop-dispatchable, so the driver skips it (like `abandoned`), but it stays
  resumable — a human flips it back to `active` when the blocker clears. `deferred`
  is distinct from `abandoned` (dead) and `done` (complete).
- **Feature** — a spec-driven *or directly-authored* unit of value, identified by
  a correlation ID `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN`. A feature owns an ordered list of gates.
- **Gate** — a milestone partition of a feature: an ordered batch of substantive
  work units followed by a mandatory closing sequence and a human review-and-arm
  checkpoint. Gates are numbered within a feature.
- **Work unit (WU)** — a single, self-contained unit of work identified by a
  task-level correlation ID `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/TNN` for substantive units,
  `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/TNNH[N…]` for hygiene units that precede a target substantive
  unit, `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-(RETRO|LESSONS|DOCS|PLAN)` for the legacy four-WU
  closing sequence, `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-CLOSE-INTERMEDIATE` +
  `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-PLAN` for the two-WU intermediate closing (non-terminal
  gates), or `FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/G<n>-CLOSE` for the single-WU terminal close.
  A WU is crafted to be completed in one focused agent session.
  It carries its own prompt and is the contract between the planner and the
  executor.

The correlation ID threads the entire lifecycle — it appears in the feature
folder name, the WU file, every event-log entry, the branch, the commit trailer
(`Feature: FEAT-YYYY-NNNN/TNN`), and (in the orchestrator) the GitHub issue.

## 2. Ownership — one fact, one home

- The **PLAN** owns the *shape*: gate order, which WUs belong to each gate, and
  the dependency edges between them.
- The **GATE** owns the *gate*: its status, its definition of done, and the
  human's reflection notes.
- The **WU** owns *itself*: its type, model, status, attempts, and prompt body.

Dependencies live in the PLAN, not in WU frontmatter: a dispatched session never
needs to know its own dependencies — they are satisfied by the time the unit is
handed to it. Dependency edges are scheduling metadata, and scheduling belongs to
the driver/PM, not to the executing session.

## 3. Work unit types

Eight types share one state machine; type affects only who handles the unit and
what its prompt contains.

Substantive:
- `implementation` — code.
- `qa_authoring` / `qa_execution` / `qa_curation` — test-plan authoring,
  execution, and regression-suite curation.

Closing sequence — every gate ends with **one** of three forms:

*Two-WU intermediate* (non-terminal gates — preferred over the legacy four-WU sequence):
- `close-intermediate` — folds retrospective, lessons, and docs into one session:
  writes `RETROSPECTIVE.md`, promotes lessons to `LEARNINGS.md`, and reconciles
  documentation. Paired with the `plan-next` unit that follows.
- `plan-next` — drafts the next gate and writes the human review summary.

*Single-WU terminal* (terminal gate of any feature):
- `close` — collapses all four ceremonies into one session: writes
  `RETROSPECTIVE.md`, promotes lessons to `LEARNINGS.md`, reconciles docs and
  roadmap, and writes the terminal feature-arc verdict. `lint_plan.py` rejects
  this type on any non-terminal gate.

*Legacy four-WU sequence* (accepted by lint but emits WARN; use two-WU or single-WU forms instead):
- `retrospective` — feature-local raw observations for the gate.
- `lessons` — promotes the *generalizable* subset of the retrospective into the
  cross-feature `LEARNINGS.md`.
- `docs` — reconciles documentation and roadmap status with what was built.
- `plan-next` — drafts the next gate and writes the human review summary.

### Deterministic auto-close path (FEAT-2026-0018)

The driver evaluates a deterministic predicate (`gate_eval.py`, predicate=v1) at
every gate boundary — intermediate and terminal — before dispatching any close WU.
The predicate exists to eliminate the human `/arm-gate` round-trip and the
hollow-pass / wiring-race brittleness class on fully on-plan gates; the full close
ceremony (retrospective, lessons, docs) remains valuable precisely when things go
off-plan, and the predicate routes each gate to the right path without AI judgment.
For the full design rationale see `PLAN.md` for FEAT-2026-0018.

**Predicate v1 — a gate auto-closes iff ALL hold:**

1. **No blocked_human in attempt chain** — no WU in this gate has `blocked_human`
   in its lifecycle events (`events.jsonl`) for this run. Re-arm history from
   FEAT-2026-0016, if present, is also inspected — any prior `blocked_human`
   cycle disables auto.
2. **No replan** — no `replan` event in `events.jsonl` for this gate's WUs.
3. **Per-WU cost ≤ 1.5× planned** — every substantive WU's `cost_usd` ≤
   `planned_cost_usd × 1.5`. If `planned_cost_usd` absent: skip this check for
   that WU (graceful degrade — emits a warning reason in the decision but doesn't
   disable auto).
4. **No WU > 2× planned** — even one substantive WU exceeding plan by > 2×
   disables auto regardless of others. Catches estimation drift like
   FEAT-2026-0015/G1-PLAN (3.8× over).
5. **Plan-next ≤ 1.5× planned** — the `plan-next` type WU is held to the same
   1.5× ceiling, enforced separately so plan-next overrun is a visible reason
   in the decision.
6. **Gate total ≤ `cost_budget_usd`** — if `GATE-NN.md` declares a budget, sum
   of all WU `cost_usd` in the gate must be ≤ budget. Absent budget: skip.
7. **No test/lint/security failures in attempt notes** — every substantive WU's
   final attempt's `attempt_outcome` must be `passed`. Earlier attempts may have
   failed (already governed by check 1 if blocked), but the FINAL outcome on
   each WU must be clean.

**Auto-close terminal** — when the predicate fires on a terminal gate, the driver
writes a stub `RETROSPECTIVE.md`, marks the close WU `status: done` with
`auto_close: true` frontmatter, and fires `fire_terminal_flips` directly. The
close WU's dispatch is skipped. The FEAT-2026-0017 invariant guard
(`assert_terminal_flips_fired`) still runs — the driver calls it after the stub
is written, so the guard exercises the same path regardless of ceremony form.

**Auto-close intermediate (option A)** — on a non-terminal gate that auto-closes,
the `close-intermediate` WU dispatch is skipped (no retrospective session, no
lessons promotion), but `plan-next` still dispatches to author the next gate's
draft work units. The human review-and-arm checkpoint therefore still fires;
auto-close only eliminates the reflective overhead, not the forward-design step.

**Override surfaces** — two escape hatches exist. Pass `--force-full-close
<feature-id>` on the CLI to bypass the predicate for a single gate and run the
full close ceremony regardless of predicate outcome. Alternatively, set
`auto_close_disabled: true` in a feature's `PLAN.md` frontmatter to disable
auto-close permanently for that feature (e.g., for features that are inherently
exploratory and expect off-plan behavior).

**Predicate-version transparency** — every `auto_close_decision` event in
`events.jsonl` carries a `predicate_version` field (e.g., `predicate_version:
v1`). Future revisions to the predicate constants increment this version, so
the audit trail for any gate boundary remains interpretable retroactively even
after v2+ revisions ship.

### Per-attempt outcome events (FEAT-2026-0016)

Every dispatched attempt emits exactly one `attempt_outcome` event to
`events.jsonl`. The payload carries a standardized set of fields:
`outcome`, `failure_class`, `failure_signature`, `failure_excerpt`,
`cost_usd`, `duration_seconds`, `attempt`, and `re_arm_count`. For
the field-by-field schema see
`.specfuse/features/FEAT-2026-0016-attempt-outcome-rearm-contract/PLAN.md`
§ "Event payload shape — `attempt_outcome` v1". The full payload is
not restated here (one fact, one home).

`outcome` taxonomy is **locked at v1**: `passed | failed | blocked |
zero_token | files_changed_mismatch | post_pass_invariant_failed |
closing_deliverable_missing | smoke_import_failed`. Extending the
taxonomy requires a deliberate versioning decision.

`failure_class` taxonomy is **locked at v1**: `tests | lint |
security | coverage | symbol_existence | bandit | other | null`.
`failure_class: other` is the explicit catch-all for paths not yet
classified; `null` means the outcome was `passed` (no failure).

Consumers that read `attempt_outcome` events (the auto-close
predicate, `/gate-status`, the spinning-detector hook, close-ceremony
cost analysis) treat the `outcome` and `failure_class` values as an
enum — new values are a breaking change.

### Re-arm WU frontmatter additions (FEAT-2026-0016)

When a WU is re-armed from `blocked_human` back to `pending`, six
cumulative audit fields track cross-attempt state:
`re_arm_count`, `re_arm_history`, `cumulative_cost_usd`,
`cumulative_duration_seconds`, `cumulative_input_tokens`,
`cumulative_output_tokens`. For the field-level spec (initialization
values, write ownership, append semantics) see
`.specfuse/templates/WU.template.md` frontmatter notes. The driver
maintains the cumulative fields; `/unblock-wu` writes `re_arm_history`
entries; `/gate-status` surfaces `re_arm_count` prominently on any WU
where it is > 0.

## 4. The five-section work-unit contract

Every dispatchable WU prompt has these five mandatory sections (a sixth,
`Objective`, is recommended but not enforced):

- **Context** — what this is part of, the correlation ID, the grounding specs/files.
- **Acceptance criteria** — explicit, machine-checkable statements of done.
- **Do not touch** — generated dirs, other units' files, secrets, branch
  protection, `.git/`.
- **Verification** — the exact gate commands that must pass.
- **Escalation triggers** — conditions under which to stop and report `blocked`
  rather than push through.

This is the same five-section contract as the orchestrator's work-unit issue
body (architecture §8). Pattern enforcement (TDD order, a required structure)
belongs in the WU prompt and the shared rules, **not** in finer WU granularity.

## 5. Verification is the exit oracle

The executing session's self-report is **advisory**. The driver (loop) or the
branch-protection gate (orchestrator) re-runs the unit's verification and *that*
decides done. For `implementation` units the gates mirror branch protection:
tests pass, coverage ≥ threshold, zero warnings, lint clean, security scan clean.
A unit that passes its own checks but would fail the real gate has done the wrong
thing. Keep the loop's `verification.yml` `code` set in lock-step with branch
protection wherever both exist.

## 6. The gate cycle

For each gate, in order:

1. **Plan.** The current gate's WUs are detailed (the first gate by the human/PM
   at feature planning; every later gate by the prior gate's `plan-next`).
2. **Execute.** The driver/PM walks the gate's ready WUs (dependencies met),
   dispatches each as a **fresh** session, verifies, and commits one squashed
   commit per unit. A failed gate is retried with a fresh session carrying the
   failure evidence, up to three attempts (the spinning threshold), then
   escalated for human attention.
3. **Close.** The closing sequence runs as the gate's last units. Three forms:
   - **Two-WU intermediate** (non-terminal gate): `close-intermediate` (folds
     retrospective + lessons + docs into one session) then `plan-next` (drafts the
     next gate and writes the human review summary).
   - **Single-WU terminal** (terminal gate): a single `close` WU collapses all
     four ceremonies; no forward-design `plan-next` is needed when there is no
     next gate.
   - **Legacy four-WU** (emits WARN): `retrospective → lessons → docs →
     plan-next` in fixed order.
4. **Review and arm.** The cycle stops for the human, who reviews the next gate's
   draft (guided by the review summary), edits or accepts it, arms the accepted
   units, and signals approval. Then the cycle repeats for the next gate.

The final gate has no next gate to plan; `plan-next` instead signals feature
completion.

### Ceremony proportionality

Closing ceremony cost should scale with feature size. A feature whose
**planned substantive** WU count (types `implementation`, `qa_authoring`,
`qa_execution`, `qa_curation`) is **≤ 4** drafts as a **single gate** with
a **single terminal `close` WU** — no `close-intermediate`, no `plan-next`.
This is the proportional shape: small features do not pay multi-WU closing
overhead sized for large ones.

**Planned count is the key.** The threshold is evaluated against the WUs
declared at planning time, not the WUs that actually ran. A feature whose
scope is revised mid-execution is an off-plan feature by definition.

**Off-plan safety net.** The decision rule is authoring-layer only. A
single-gate feature whose gate goes off-plan (blocked WU, replan event,
cost overrun) still receives the full close ceremony via the `gate_eval`
auto-close predicate (§3 "Deterministic auto-close path"): the predicate
disables auto-close and the driver dispatches the closing WU as a normal
reflective session. Ceremony proportionality trades reflection only on
features that stay small **and** on-plan. The `gate_eval.py` predicate is
the safety net; this rule does not replace it.

The canonical threshold is **4** (stated here, in `docs/methodology.md`;
referenced, not re-defined, in `.specfuse/skills/draft-feature/SKILL.md`).

### Fresh context per dispatch

Each WU is executed by a new session. All durable state lives in the PLAN, the
GATE/WU files, git history, the event log, and per-unit failure notes — never in
a context window. This is the Ralph property, kept at work-unit granularity
because units are sized to land in one pass.

## 7. plan-next and the review summary

`plan-next` is forward design — the one act in the cycle that is not synthesis
against a log — and takes the strongest model. It reads the gate retrospective
and the cross-feature `LEARNINGS.md`, drafts the next gate's WUs, and may revise
*not-yet-reached* gates (split/merge/re-scope), surfacing any such change loudly
in the review summary. It never touches a gate already passed.

It **drafts but never arms.** Arming — accepting the drafted units so they
execute — is the human's act (or, under automatic mode, a mechanically-gated
auto-arm; see §9). This preserves the highest-leverage human checkpoint: catching
a misframed gate before it becomes merged code.

The review summary is weighted toward **doubt**, not completeness: decisions and
their rationale, an explicit "if you check only three things, check these" list,
a roadmap-anchor check (with a loud flag if the goal itself seems to be drifting),
and open questions — each mapped to the draft WU it affects. The summary is
advisory and owns no state.

## 8. LEARNINGS — the cross-feature feedback loop

`LEARNINGS.md` is an append-only, cross-feature log of durable, reusable rules
distilled by each gate's `lessons` unit. It is read at planning time so each
plan is better than the last. Feature-specific observations stay in that
feature's `RETROSPECTIVE.md`; only rules that would change how a *future* WU is
written or executed graduate to `LEARNINGS.md`. This is the human-scale analogue
of the Ralph loop feeding errors back into the prompt.

## 9. Autonomy

Three levels — `auto`, `review`, `supervised` — set as a feature default and
overridable per gate (tightening only; a gate may be more supervised than the
feature default, never less). Under `auto`, the per-gate stop may be skipped
(plan-next auto-arms the next gate) **only when all of**: the structural lint
passes, the not-yet-reached skeleton was not revised, no task in the gate carries
a `supervised`/auto-forbidden override, and plan-next raised no escalation. If any
fails, the cycle stops for the human regardless of mode. Auto-arm advances toward
execution; it never auto-merges — the merge gate stays human until the QA loop is
trusted. Escalation always overrides autonomy.

## 10. The two execution surfaces

| Concern        | Loop (single-repo)                  | Orchestrator (multi-repo)              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| State backend  | WU / GATE file frontmatter          | GitHub issue labels + feature registry |
| Dispatch       | driver shells out (`claude -p`)     | inbox files + polling loop             |
| Branch / merge | one branch, squash per WU            | branch + PR per task, merge watcher    |
| Spec front-end | optional; task graph authored directly | spec-first (specs agent + codegen)  |

Everything above those rows — the unit hierarchy, ownership split, WU contract,
verification-as-oracle, the gate cycle, plan-next, LEARNINGS, and autonomy — is
shared and means the same thing on both surfaces.
